NOTES & DECISIONS
=====================================

DEPLOYMENT DECISION:
- Vercel for MVP (Perfect for static sites)
- No backend needed initially
- Can add Java backend later
- Focus on frontend excellence

NFT DECISION:
- ðŸ”„ Optional feature (implement if time permits)
- Complex APIs (OpenSea, Rarible, Alchemy)
- Rate limiting and costs to consider
- Good learning opportunity for advanced API integration
- Can showcase if implemented
- Not critical for MVP, but impressive if added

NFT IMPLEMENTATION (If Pursued):
- OpenSea API for marketplace data
- Alchemy NFT API for metadata
- Display NFT collections and trending items
- Basic NFT price tracking
- Simple gallery view
- Link to external marketplaces

DATABASE DECISION:
- PostgreSQL for future backend
- JSON support for crypto data
- ACID compliance for financial data
- Open source, no licensing costs

DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:
- Start simple (mock data)
- Add complexity gradually
- Focus on UI/UX first
- Add state management later
- Test after core functionality works
