- Transactions table

=====================================
PHASE 4: INTEGRATION & TESTING (2-3 weeks)
=====================================
GOAL: Connect frontend to backend and implement comprehensive testing

TASKS:
- [ ] Connect Angular frontend to Java backend
- [ ] Implement JWT authentication

- API tests (Postman/Newman)
- Performance tests (Lighthouse)

=====================================
PHASE 5: DEPLOYMENT & PRODUCTION (1-2 weeks)
=====================================
GOAL: Deploy to production and monitor performance

TASKS:
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to cloud infrastructure
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Implement backup strategies
- [ ] Add health checks and alerts
- [ ] Performance monitoring

DELIVERABLES:
- Production-ready application
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring and alerting system
- Documentation

DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
- Frontend: Vercel (Current)
- Backend: AWS/Google Cloud
- Database: PostgreSQL (Cloud)
- Monitoring: Sentry, LogRocket

=====================================
CURRENT FOCUS: MVP FOR RECRUITERS
=====================================

IMMEDIATE GOALS (Next 2 weeks):
1. Complete all visualizations (bubble, heatmap, table)
2. Implement row selection for all views
3. Add search and filtering
4. Ensure responsive design
5. Deploy to Vercel with custom domain
6. Create professional README
7. Prepare demo scenarios

RECRUITER SHOWCASE FEATURES:
- Interactive bubble chart with crypto data
- Heatmap visualization with color coding
- Sortable price table with real-time updates
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Modern tech stack (Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Professional deployment (Vercel)

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS TO MENTION:
- Angular Standalone Components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Component-based architecture
- Responsive design principles
- Modern deployment practices

=====================================
NOTES & DECISIONS
=====================================

DEPLOYMENT DECISION:
- Vercel for MVP (Perfect for static sites)
- No backend needed initially
- Can add Java backend later
- Focus on frontend excellence

DATABASE DECISION:
- PostgreSQL for future backend
- JSON support for crypto data
- ACID compliance for financial data
- Open source, no licensing costs

DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:
- Start simple (mock data)
- Add complexity gradually
- Focus on UI/UX first
- Add state management later
- Test after core functionality works
